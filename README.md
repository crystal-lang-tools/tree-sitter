# tree-sitter-crystal

This is a WIP implementation of [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) for the [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) programming language. This is part of a drive to increase Crystal tooling across workflows and IDEs, and specifically to consolidate efforts to create a tree-sitter implementation for Crystal. See [this forum post](https://forum.crystal-lang.org//t/tree-sitter-crystal/3565) for more context on this repos creation.
